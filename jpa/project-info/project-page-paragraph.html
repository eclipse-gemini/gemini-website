The Gemini JPA project provides JPA users with the ability to use their favorite persistence API in a modular environment. It ships its own bundles which, when installed with the EclipseLink provider bundles and the OSGi Enterprise specification API bundle, allows JPA persistence units and entity managers to be registered and accessed as services.
