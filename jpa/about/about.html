<p>The Gemini JPA project provides the ability to leverage JPA persistence in a modular environment. 
It is the continuation of the Reference Implementation for the JPA chapter of the OSGi Alliance Enterprise Specification, and layers above EclipseLink to offer an OSGi Enterprise Specification compliant JPA provider. A Gemini DB Access module can be used by the provider to read and write through the JDBC driver.
