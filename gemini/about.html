<p>The Enterprise Modules Project (Gemini) is all about modular implementations 
of Java EE technology. It provides the ability for users to consume individual modules as needed, 
without requiring unnecessary additional runtime pieces. 
<p>Gemini is composed of subprojects, each of which implements a specific modularized technology. The modules are targeted at OSGi frameworks.
